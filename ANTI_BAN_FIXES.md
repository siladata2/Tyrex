# 🛡️ TYREX_KSH MD v9.0 — Anti-Ban Fix Documentation

## ❌ What Was Causing WhatsApp Bans

### 1. `forwardingScore: 999 + isForwarded: true` (CRITICAL 🔴)
Every single message the bot sent — welcome, ping, menu, ALL commands — included:
```js
forwardingScore: 999, isForwarded: true,
forwardedNewsletterMessageInfo: { newsletterJid, ... }
```
This is the **#1 ban trigger**. It makes every message look like mass-forwarded spam to WhatsApp's systems. Removed from all messages.

### 2. Browser Fingerprint: `Browsers.macOS('Safari')` (HIGH 🟠)
Safari on macOS is an unusual and suspicious fingerprint for automated connections.
**Fixed to:** `Browsers.ubuntu('Chrome')` — most common, lowest detection rate.

### 3. Presence Spam: `goOffline()` called after EVERY message (HIGH 🟠)
The original code called `sendPresenceUpdate('unavailable')` after every single message batch — potentially hundreds of times per hour. WhatsApp rate-limits presence updates aggressively.
**Fixed:** Presence re-apply interval changed from **30 seconds → 5 minutes**.

### 4. Auto-Join Group on EVERY Connect (MEDIUM 🟡)
On every connection/reconnect, the bot automatically joined the owner's WhatsApp group. Repeated join requests = spam detection.
**Fixed:** `AUTO_GROUP_JOIN=false` by default. Set in `.env` only if needed.

### 5. Aggressive Reconnect: 10 attempts, 3s delay (MEDIUM 🟡)
10 rapid reconnects after disconnect = suspicious behaviour pattern.
**Fixed:** Max 5 reconnects with **exponential backoff + jitter** (5s→10s→15s+random).

### 6. `keepAliveIntervalMs: 10000` — Too Frequent (MEDIUM 🟡)
WS keep-alive pings every 10 seconds creates excessive traffic.
**Fixed:** `keepAliveIntervalMs: 30_000` (30 seconds, matching FIX project).

### 7. Bomber/Spammer Plugins Loaded (CRITICAL 🔴)
`smsbomber.js`, `bomber.js`, `boomber.js` were being loaded and registered as commands. These send mass messages and will get any account banned immediately.
**Fixed:** These plugins are permanently skipped in the plugin loader.

### 8. Status Reaction Spam (LOW 🟢)
Auto-reacting to every single status with no rate limit.
**Fixed:** Added rate limiter — max 30 status reactions per minute.

### 9. Staggered Session Reload (NEW ✅)
Multiple sessions were reconnecting simultaneously on startup.
**Fixed:** 3-second delay between each session reload.
